# Mechanical_CAD_Projects
various mini CAD projects I've done

This repo contains some of the CAD projects I have done in my free time using onShape (an online editor hence the lack of commits)

Currently completed projects include:
A 20 sided dice container for one set of Dungeon and Dragons dice
A cookie cutter template that was made using a image 
Oscilloscope clips to replace the broken ones my current scope

I am currently working on:
A replacement stove knob for my gran's cooker
A spin down variant (life counter) of the D20 container
